0. Check left side encoder feedback, motors 4 & 5 (right side OK)

1. Tune arm PID so that we can have set position buttons and so that we can set up the set position buttons
Status: In que

1.5. Make sure that the robot can move in autonomous and we can go under the low-bar if aligned correctly (even if that means taking out the custon sub vi and putting it in running, you know)
Status: In queue

2. Turning Autonomous
Status: In queue

3. Autonomous
	-hold arm up
	-shoot low goal
Status: In que 
4. Re-map all of Drew's many, many, many, many, many, buttons
	-switch a few buttons functionality
	-button increments (check to see if it works in the PID arm sub vi)
Stauts: No longer "in que", we got 'er done


5. Add the second camera
	-decide how to display the view from the second camera (investigate having a second screen)
Status: In que

6. Make Dan's hand better (possible PID)
Status: In que

6.5. Add in Chase's reflective tape vision program, relation to the movement of the robot
Status: In que

7. Sensing obstacles using sensors of sorts (sonar, etc...)
Status: In que

8. Dan's hand moves back, motors rev up, Dan's hand pushes the ball forward, he shoots...he scores
Status: In que









100,003,000. Noah's one shot wonder
Status: We'll get to it after we make single button that wins the entire game and makes Ian 6' 8". So pretty soon!
